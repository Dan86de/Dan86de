## Hi My name is Daniel Noworyta :wave:

### From the moment I saw red light on the Commodore 64 power indicator I knew this is my thing. Since 2012 Iâ€™m working as a mechanical engineer in automotive industry. Everytime when Iâ€™m coming back home from my current work Iâ€™m sitting in front of my desk and starting typing code. Around two years ago Iâ€™ve decided to commit myself to change industry. I'm currently looking for junior frontend web dev position. Below You can find examples of my work.
