Hi there ðŸ‘‹!
I am Daniel

Working in automotive industry design department taught me how to be a part of large projects for most German brands. Result and time pressure requires from me precise information exchange and excellent time and budget management skills. Cooperation with many technology departments whose objectives are not necessarily overlap, requires skills of negotiation and compromise finding. With that proven background in Automotive Industy, I am looking to transition into IT World.

Why coding? Well, since I remember I was really interested in Internet and Computers. That passion started when my father bought me first computer (Commodore 64). Moment when I saw red light of power indicator changed my life. I was coding in my free time for myself. Doing some web UI/UX Design and simple projects. My communication and problem solving skills helped me during my Automotive career.
